# README

The ultimate goal is to assess the candidate's passion for quality and activeness as a collaborator. An active collaborator who cares about quality will drive a healthy culture that lifts others in the squad.

## Where are the repos?

All repos are private, including the test templates.

Please request access to the [CBA Engineers](https://github.com/orgs/CBA-Tech-Recruiting/teams/cba-engineers) by pinging one of the maintainers.

## Format

Each candidate will have a private git repo created for them, with a pull request upon which they are to perform a review.

The PR will contain issues which the candidate should identify in the review.

We will assess their submission and discuss it in the technical interview.

## Process

### Preparation

1. Generate the candidate repo from the [repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) in this org. Each template is effectively a test, and so they form the test catalog.
2. Ensure the repository is `private`
3. Invite the candidate to our org and add them as a collaborator to their repo
4. Provide a link to your Talent Aquisition contact who will pass it on to the candidate.

### Exam

The candidate will perform the PR in their own time.

### Interview

Discuss their submission.

### Post interview

1. Share the feedback to the candidate.
1. After a week or so, delete the candidate's repo
1. Remove the candidate from the organisation
